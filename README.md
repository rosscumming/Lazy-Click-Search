# Lazy-Click-Search (WIP)

A Chrome Extension to quickly search YouTube, Reddit(old.reddit or new!), and Amazon(UK & US). Simply right click on the desired text and select your chosen platform to search.

## TODO

More functionality and quality of life changes to be added.

- [x] Allow option to search old.reddit instead.
- [ ] Allow option for user to add additional "Search by Google" parameters e.g Strict match search by default
- [ ] Create an options page, there is none currently.
- [ ] Flesh out Popup.html for easier user interaction.
